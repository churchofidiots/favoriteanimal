                    <br><em>Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals.
                <br> As an informal and colloquial grouping, they correspond to large members of the infraorder Cetacea,
                <br> i.e. all cetaceans apart from dolphins and porpoises.</em>

                    <li> Whales are mammals:Despite living in the ocean, whales are mammals, meaning they breathe air, have skin (not scales), are warm-blooded, give birth to live young, and feed their young with milk.
                    <li> They can hold their breath for a very long time: Whales have evolved to hold their breath for extended periods, allowing them to dive deep in search of food.</li>
                    <li> Whales are incredibly large: Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet and weighing around 200 tons. </li>
                    <li> They use different feeding strategies: Baleen whales strain krill and plankton with baleen plates, while toothed whales actively hunt and eat fish, squid, and other marine life. </li>
                    <li> Some whales are very social: Whales often travel and communicate in groups, forming strong social bonds. </li>
                    <li> Whale poop is a valuable nutrient source: Whale "pump" or "whale poop" helps move nutrients from the deep ocean to the surface, benefiting phytoplankton and the overall ocean ecosystem. </li>
                    <li> Whales migrate long distances: Gray whales undertake one of the longest migrations of any mammal, traveling thousands of miles to breeding grounds. </li>
                    <li> Whales can be very loud: The blue whale is known as one of the loudest animals on Earth, with vocalizations reaching 188 decibels. </li>
                    <li> Some whales have multiple stomachs: Certain whale species have a multi-chambered stomach, aiding in digestion of their prey. </li>
                    <li> Whales have long lifespans: Bowhead whales can live for up to 200 years, while orcas and humpbacks can live for over 100 and 80 years, respectively. </li>
