                        <br><strong>What are Whales?</strong>
                        <br><em>Whales are large, intelligent marine mammals that live full-time in the ocean. They breathe air through lungs (not gills!), 
                            <br>give birth to live young, and are warm-blooded—basically, they’re giant sea mammals, not fish. There are two main types: 
                            <br>baleen whales, which filter-feed tiny organisms like krill (think blue whales, humpbacks), and toothed whales,
                            <br> which hunt fish and squid (like orcas and sperm whales).</em>
                            <br><strong>Where do they Live?</strong>
                        <br><em>Whales live in oceans all over the world, from the freezing Arctic and Antarctic waters to warm tropical seas. 
                            <br>Some species stick to specific regions year-round, while others migrate thousands of miles between feeding and breeding grounds. 
                            <br>They rely on clean, healthy oceans with plenty of food and space to roam.</em>

                    <li> 🐋 Biggest Animal Ever – The blue whale isn’t just the biggest whale, it's the biggest animal to 
                        <br>have ever lived on Earth—beating out all the dinosaurs. Their hearts are the size of small cars!</li>
                    <li>🌊 Long-Distance Chat – Some whales, like humpbacks, can communicate across hundreds of miles using low-
                        <br>frequency sounds. Basically the ocean’s long-distance phone plan.</li>
                    <li>🎶 Whale Songs – Male humpbacks sing complex songs that can last 20 minutes and repeat for hours. No one’s
                        <br> 100% sure why, but it’s probably whale karaoke or trying to impress a date.</li>
                    <li>🧠 Brainy Beasts – Sperm whales have the largest brains of any animal on Earth, weighing around 17 pounds. 
                        <br>They’re clever, social, and pass down knowledge through generations—like sea-grandmas and grandpas.</li>
                    <li>💤 Half-Asleep Hack – Whales sleep with half their brain awake so they can keep swimming and remember to breathe. 
                        <br>Can’t relate, but we respect it.</li>
                    <li>🐳 Narwhals Are Real – The “unicorns of the sea” are a species of whale, and their tusk is actually a giant 
                        <br>sensitive tooth that can detect changes in water temperature and pressure.</li>
                    <li>⚓ Deep Divers – Sperm whales can dive over 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) and hold their breath for up to
                        <br>90 minutes. Meanwhile, we get winded walking up stairs.</li>
